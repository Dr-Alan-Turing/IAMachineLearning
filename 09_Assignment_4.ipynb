    "## Description of the datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on two datasets:\n",
    "1. the 20 Newsgroups Dataset (you should recognise it from Assignment 1)\n",
    "2. the MNIST digits dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### 20 Newsgroups\n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we repeat the description here. This dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Some of the newsgroups are very closely related to each other (e.g. comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware, comp.sys.mac.hardware), while others are highly unrelated (e.g misc.forsale, soc.religion.christian). \n",
    "\n",
    "To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we preprocessed the original dataset. We will use documents from only 5 out of the 20 newsgroups, which results in a 5-class problem. More specifically the 5 classes correspond to the following newsgroups: \n",
    "1. `alt.atheism`\n",
    "2. `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`\n",
    "3. `comp.sys.mac.hardware`\n",
    "4. `rec.sport.baseball`\n",
    "5. `rec.sport.hockey `\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note here that classes 2-3 and 4-5 are rather closely related.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In contrast to Assignment 1**, we have opted to use tf-idf weights ([term frequency - inverse document frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf))\n",
    "for each word instead of the frequency counts. These weights represent the importance of a word to a\n",
    "document with respect to a collection of documents. The importance increases proportionally to the number\n",
    "of times a word appears in the document and decreases proportionally to the number of times the word\n",
    "appears in the whole corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally we preprocess the data to include the most frequent 1000 words that are in greater than 2 documents, less than half of all documents, and that are not [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform all this preprocessing for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MNIST\n",
    "This MNIST Dataset is a collection handwritten digits. The samples are partitioned (nearly) evenly across the 10 different digit classes {0, 1, . . . , 9}. We use a preprocessed version for which the data are $8 \\times 8$ pixel images containing one digit each. For further details on how the digits are preprocessed, see the sklearn documentation. The images are grayscale, with each pixel taking values in {0, 1, . . . , 16}, where 0 corresponds to black (weakest intensity) and 16 corresponds to white (strongest intensity). Therefore, the dataset is a N × 64\n",
    "dimensional matrix where each dimension corresponds to a pixel from the image and N is the number of\n",
    "images. \n",

Observing common words within each cluster may allow us to give meaning to these inferred labels too.\n",

Finally, we will pretend we don't know the number of clusters there should be, as is the normal scenario with large unlabeled data, and investigate the effect of using a different number of cluster centres (i.e. varying `k`)."
